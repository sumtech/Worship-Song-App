[Chorus]
{G}I'm {C}trading my{Em} sorrow{D}
{G}I'm {C}trading my{Em} shame{D}

{G}I'm {C}trading my{Em} sickness{D}
{G}I'm {C}trading my{Em} pain{D}
{G}I'm {C}laying them {Em}down for the {D}joy of the {G}Lord {C}  {Em}   {D}

And we say {G}yes Lord, {C}yes Lord, {Em}yes, yes, {D}Lord
{G}Yes Lord, {C}yes Lord, {Em}yes, yes, {D}Lord
{G}Yes Lord, {C}yes Lord, {Em}yes, yes, {D}Lord. Am{G}en {C}  {Em}   {D}

[Verse]
I'm {G}pressed but not {C}crushed
perse{Em}cuted not a{D}bandoned
{G}Struck {C}down but not de{Em}stroyed {D}
I'm {G}blessed beyond the {C}curse
for His {Em}promise will en{D}dure
{G}And His {C}joy's gonna be my {Em}stren{D}gth
{D}Though the sorrow may last for the night
{F}His joy comes with the {C}morning...
