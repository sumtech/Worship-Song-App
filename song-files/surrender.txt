======================

[Verse 1]
{G}I'm giving you my {D}heart, and all that is with{C2}in
I lay it all {Em}down for the {D/F#}sake of you my {G}King
{G}I'm giving you my {D}dreams, I'm laying down my {C2}rights
I'm giving up my {Em}pride for the {D/F#}promise of a new {G}life

[Chorus]
And {Em}I  {D/F#} sur{G}render {C2}all to {G}you, {Em7}all to {D}you {C2}
And {Em}I  {D/F#} sur{G}render {C2}all to {G}you, {Em7}all to {D}you {C2}

[Verse 2]
{G}I'm singing you this {D}song, I'm waiting at the {C2}cross
And all the world holds {Em}dear, I {D/F#}count it all as {G}loss
{G}For the sake of knowing {D}You, for the glory of Your {C2}name
To know the lasting {Em}joy, even {D/F#}sharing in Your {G}pain
